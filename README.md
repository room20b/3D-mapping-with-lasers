# 3D-mapping-with-lasers
A system for generating a 3D map of an environment using lasers!

#### Once all packages are installed and the system is set up simply run the following.
$ python bl.py (to connect to bluetooth receiver)

$ python cam.py (to run the entire setup)

$ python GLmap.py (to generate the 3D point cloud using the data collected)
